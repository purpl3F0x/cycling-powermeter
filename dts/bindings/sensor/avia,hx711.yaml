  Avia HX711 sensor

compatible: "avia,hx711"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  sample-fetch-timeout-ms:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 700
    description: |
      Time until sample-fetch will wait before returning an error.
      Most module implementations have a wake-up time after power up of about 600ms.
      Default set to 700ms to ensure most implementations will work.
      Increase if necessary.

  gain:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 1
    description: |
      Gain of the sensor. 1 = 128x, 2 = 32x, 3 = 64x.
      Default set to 1(128x) as this is the sensors default setting after power-up.
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3

  rate-hz:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Sensor sample rate. 0 = 10Hz, 1 = 80Hz
      User should provide initial value depending on HW implementation.
      If CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME = y rate will not be higher
      than 2~3Hz due to the long wake-up time needed for HX711.
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1

  dout-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Pin on which sensor data will be read from.

  sck-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Pin on which data fetch triggering occurs.

  rate-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      Pin on which sampling rate is chosen.
